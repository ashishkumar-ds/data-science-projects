# Dissect App Event Metrics for Experimentation

### Project Summary  
Mapped and analyzed the Gojek appâ€™s food-ordering flow to support product experimentation and improve user experience and retention.

---

### What Was Done  
- Defined the **user journey** with screenshots of key in-app events.
- Identified critical **conversion and retention touchpoints** in the ordering funnel.
- Collaborated with product management to **define event names**, data points, and **key metrics** for in-app experiments.

---

### Outcome  
- Established a clean event taxonomy to track user behavior effectively.
- Enabled data-driven experimentation to drive conversion and retention improvements across the funnel.
