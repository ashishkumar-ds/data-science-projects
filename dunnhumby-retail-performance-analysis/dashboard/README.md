# Store Performance Tracking - Dashboard

This dashboard is created as part of the Dunnhumby retail analytics project to help stakeholders monitor underperforming stores, customer segments, and the impact of campaign recommendations in real time.

## Purpose & Design Framework

Built using stakeholder-first principles and following the standard dashboard design process:

| Step | Focus | Details |
|------|-------|---------|
| **1. Who** | Target Users | C-level executives, retail managers, and non-technical business stakeholders |
| **2. Why** | Purpose | Track store performance, understand campaign impact, support data-driven decisions |
| **3. What** | Metrics Displayed | Total Sales, Transactions, AOV, Customer Segments, Category Sales, Store Comparison |
| **4. How** | Visualization Logic | Line charts, bar charts, and tree maps comparing trends, segments, and store rankings |
| **5. When** | Usage Frequency | Ideal for weekly/monthly business reviews and post-campaign impact checks |

## Why These Metrics?

Each metric included in the dashboard was intentionally selected to answer a key business question:

- **Total Sales & Transactions** – Are we growing in revenue and traffic?
- **Average Order Value (AOV)** – Are customers spending more per visit?
- **Customer Segments (RFM)** – Which customers are loyal, at risk, or promising?
- **Category Sales** – What departments drive revenue, and which need attention?
- **Store Comparison** – Which locations are underperforming or improving?
- **Sales Trend** – How have campaigns or seasons impacted weekly performance?
