# Dashboard - Store Performance Tracking 

This dashboard is created as part of the Dunnhumby retail analytics project to help stakeholders monitor underperforming stores, customer segments, and the impact of campaign recommendations in real time.

## Purpose & Design Framework

Built using stakeholder-first principles and following the standard dashboard design process:

| Step | Focus | Details |
|------|-------|---------|
| **1. Who** | Target Users | C-level executives, retail managers, and non-technical business stakeholders |
| **2. Why** | Purpose | Track store performance, understand campaign impact, support data-driven decisions |
| **3. What** | Metrics Displayed | Total Sales, Transactions, AOV, Customer Segments, Category Sales, Store Comparison |
| **4. How** | Visualization Logic | Line charts, bar charts, and tree maps comparing trends, segments, and store rankings |
| **5. When** | Usage Frequency | Ideal for daily/weekly business reviews and post-campaign impact checks |

## Why These Metrics?

Each metric included in the dashboard was intentionally selected to answer a key business question:

- **Total Sales & Transactions** –  Are we seeing growth in store activity and order volume?
- **Average Order Value (AOV)** – How much are customers spending per visit?
- **Customer Segments (RFM)** – How many customers are loyal, at risk, or promising?
- **Category Sales** – Which product departments are driving revenue, and which need attention?
- **Store Comparison** – Which store are underperforming or improving?
- **Sales Trend** – How is daily or weekly performance trending, and what is the impact of active campaigns?
