# Dashboard – Store Performance Monitoring

This dashboard was created as part of the Dunnhumby retail analytics project to help stakeholders monitor underperforming stores, customer segments, and the impact of campaign recommendations in real time.

## Dashboard Purpose & Design Framework

Built using stakeholder-first principles and following the standard dashboard design process (Who → Why → What → How → When → Design):

| Step | Focus | Details |
|------|-------|---------|
| **1. Who** | Target Users | C-level executives, retail managers, and non-technical business stakeholders |
| **2. Why** | Purpose | Track store performance, understand campaign impact, support data-driven decisions |
| **3. What** | Metrics Displayed | Total Sales, Transactions, AOV, Customer Segments, Category Sales, Store Comparison |
| **4. How** | Visualization Logic | Line charts, bar charts, and tree maps comparing trends, segments, and store rankings |
| **5. When** | Usage Frequency | Ideal for weekly/monthly business reviews and post-campaign impact checks |

## Why These Metrics?

Each metric included in the dashboard was intentionally selected to answer a key business question:

- **Total Sales & Transactions** – Are we growing in revenue and traffic?
- **Average Order Value (AOV)** – Are customers spending more per visit?
- **Customer Segments (RFM)** – Which customers are loyal, at risk, or promising?
- **Category Sales** – What departments drive revenue, and which need attention?
- **Store Comparison** – Which locations are underperforming or improving?
- **Sales Trend** – How have campaigns or seasons impacted weekly performance?
