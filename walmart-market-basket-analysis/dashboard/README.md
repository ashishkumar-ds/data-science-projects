# Product Performance – KPI Dashboard

This dashboard was created as the final delivery layer of the Walmart Market Basket Analysis project.  
It visualizes key product-level KPIs and simulates the potential impact of bundling, co-placement, and promotional strategies using historical transaction data.

To make the insights more actionable, the dashboard includes interactive filters for **Year** and **District (store location)** — enabling stakeholders to explore how performance and strategy effectiveness vary across time and geography.

## Purpose & Design Framework

This KPI dashboard is built using a stakeholder-first approach and follows the standard dashboard design process:

| Step | Focus | Details |
|------|-------|---------|
| **1. Who** | Target Users | Retail managers, category planners, merchandising teams, and business stakeholders |
| **2. Why** | Purpose | Simulate the impact of bundling and promotion strategies on retail KPIs using historical data |
| **3. What** | KPIs Displayed | Sales, Profit, Orders, Profit Margin — segmented by Product, Category, and Sub-Category |
| **4. How** | Visualization Logic | KPI cards with ± trend indicators, bar charts, pie charts, sub-category tables, and dynamic filters |
| **5. When** | Usage Frequency | Strategic reviews, product mix planning, and campaign simulations |

## Why These KPIs?

Each KPI and chart was carefully selected to illustrate how insights from Market Basket Analysis can support business decisions:

- **Sales & Orders** – Do bundled product combinations show potential to drive higher volume and transaction count?  
- **Profit & Profit Margin** – Are the suggested combinations likely to improve profitability and margin efficiency?  
- **Category & Sub-Category Trends** – Where should merchandising or category teams focus attention to improve performance?  
- **Product-Level Insights** – Which specific products are strong candidates for bundling, co-placement, or promotion?

## Note

This dashboard does not track real-time post-implementation results.  
Instead, it uses historical data to simulate and visualize how the recommended strategies — such as bundling frequently bought items or improving product placement — could impact key retail KPIs.
